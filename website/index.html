        <h2>We have a serious problem with food</h2>
        <div class="quote">"Most of my food has travelled more in its lifetime than I have in mine”</div>
        <p>
          <br/>
          <br/>
            Imported food accounts for 70 percent of the climate impact in Sweden. Due to poor transportation and harvest practices, lots of food end up spoiling before it even reaches our dinner tables. In addition fresh fruit and vegetables contribute to almost half the food waste in our homes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          In the Nordics we have a short growth season and are accustomed to having access to non-native fruits and vegetables all year round. Although we use 90% fossil-free energy in Sweden for heating, we import 7 out of 10 tomatoes from The Netherlands. The imported fresh food travels far and for long periods of time, and we end up eating food that has lost a significant level of nutrition.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Currently, 850 million people are undernourished, but almost 2 billion people are overweight or obese. And we eat way too much meat for our own good, emitting billions of tons of greenhouse gases, adding to biodiversity loss, acidification and eutrophication, and using farmland that could provide more food if we use it to grow produce (or house a rainforest).
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Agricultural practices accounts for 25% of the our planet’s greenhouse gas emissions, and 70% of all water withdrawals globally.

        <h2>We have a serious problem with population and urbanization</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1990 and 2017, the human population living in urban areas nearly doubled, from ca 2.3 billion people to 4.1 billion. By 2050, it's projected that 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas. And we also spend more time indoors than ever before.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          It means that soon, there will be fewer people farming the land than there are people to feed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Urbanization also makes space cramped. We have to contend with less space to house ourselves, our families, and our lives upon. It creates more pollution concentrated to the same geographical area and our buildings trap heat when global warming is changing the climate. With the climate change, occurrences like heavier rainfall, heat strokes and storms make outdoor farming less predictable and less secure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Although the annual population increase of the planet is 82 million people per year - lower than it has been since the 1960’s - it still puts heavy pressure on our planet’s carrying capacity as we live longer. Now, more than ever, high crop yield and resourceful farming of locally produced food is key.

          <h2>How Hollbium helps</h2>
          <h3>Sustainable Food Supply</h3>
          <p>
            Lets face it, growing your own food is an awesome trend that is here to stay! Studies have shown that by becoming more connected to your food, it will help you to avoid waste. Food that you’ve grown yourself is the ultimate gift to yourself and your loved ones.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            By using “free space” like walls and pillars, we make sure to optimize every sqr mtr in your home or office. By growing food in a controlled indoor climate, our food supply will be secure from climate change hazards and as locally grown as can be.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hollbium uses hydroponic technology growing greens, using 90% less water than conventional outdoor farming.
          </p>
          <h3>People’s well-being</h3>
          <p>
            Plants make people happy. And food makes people happy too. So why not keep edible plants at your home or your office? By using Hollbium’s systems and services, growing food indoors is easy. We control and optimize the nutrients that the plants need, and make sure they don’t get sun-burned or too little light.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The food that is locally grown will retain a much higher nutrition value than imported food. Plus it will stay fresh longer than refrigerated greens. Maybe, and just maybe, growing wonderful and tasty greens could also help us to eat a little less meat? The choice is yours!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Lets make people happier through sustainable food supply, and save the planet!

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a modern startup that combines sustainable food supply and people well-being. As metropolitan workspaces become more and more cramped, we want to increase the well-being of inhabitants and employees, as well as work towards a sustainable future. We bring the nature indoors, by growing edible plants in your workspace or home. Imagine no longer having to import fruits and greens from overseas to your table. Instead, many of the imported greens can be locally grown, all seasons of the year.</p>
